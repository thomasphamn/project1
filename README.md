### BikeStores-Dashboard

**Problem Statement**

An analysis of the revenue data for a chain of bicycle stores that sell products to customers in the United States. I used dashboards to display store sales analytics and presented them to management.

**Dataset Used**

A historical dataset with 4723 rows and 12 columns. Data is stored in a single table.

**Analyses derived from the dataset**
Sales analysis for 3 years 2016-2018, by month of the year, by store, state, brand, product category, top 10 customers, and sales rep.
